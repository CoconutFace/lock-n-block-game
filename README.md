# lock-n-block-game
Source code for my lock n' block game

This is my first game, i created it in pygame, If you have any ideas on how i can improve the code, please let me know.
I would like to make my code simpler if possible, it feels like it is a little too cluttered.
I also have a few ideas for mechanics i want to add, but don't have the experience to implement them properly.
these include, changing the spike's position after every level, rotating walls,
walls that dissapear and reappear after a set amount of time, and a button that spawns the key.
I have tried to implement theese mechanics but had no luck, if you have and ideas, or pointers,
please let me know. I appreciate any help.
